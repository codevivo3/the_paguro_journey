# The Paguro Journey 🌍

A slow-travel storytelling platform combining long-form articles, destinations, and video content.

This project explores how travel stories can be presented with clarity, calm design, and long-term scalability in mind — avoiding clutter, hype, and short-form noise.

## ✨ Project Overview

**The Paguro Journey** is a modern web platform designed to grow over time:

- Editorial blog posts (long-form, SEO-friendly)
- Destination-based exploration (geographic & thematic)
- Video integration (YouTube)
- Clean UI with focus on readability and calm navigation

The project is currently in **active development** and serves both as:
- a real collaborative project, and
- a portfolio piece demonstrating architecture, design decisions, and scalability.
